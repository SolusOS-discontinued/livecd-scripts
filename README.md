SolusOS 2 LiveCD Scripts
========================

The scripts in this repository are used to create SolusOS 2 LiveCD's

**Layout**:

     LiveOS/
     LiveOS/squashfs.img
     isolinux/
     isolinux/{isolinux_files}

Special Notes:
---
These scripts were never completed and pretty much hard-coded to my
home directory. Feel free to change as required and adapt them to
generic use.
